### Extra hot tips ###
######################

    Open circle is the best for aggregate data
    Ensure strong visual boundaries for different symbols plotted (circle, plus, star, carrot)
    Make different navigational elements visually distinct
    Use shapes before color
        - Use color semantically if possible
        - avoid color if it introduces false relations
    Use horizontal charts for long labels
    Highlight interesting data so the reader's eye goes to the right place

### Introduction/Elements of Style ###
######################################
 
    Narrative
        - visualizations should serve the story
        - There should be only one conlcusion to be drawn from a figure

    Pre-/post-attentive
        - does my figure require a "serial search" / does it have conjunction target
        - Try to have only 1 unique pattern/characteristic that people can notice

    Gestalt Principles
        - Figure/ground
        - Similar shape, size
        - Proximity
        - Connection
        - Common region - objects in the same closed region are grouped
        - Continuity
        - Enclosure
        - Focal point

    Salient features <==> STAND OUT

    Make different navigational elements visually distinct

    Use shapes before color -- Use color semantically if possible

    Best/summary info should be the FIRST in the caption


### Matplotlib ###
##################

    (PROJECT) --> phonon plot 
        - make horizontal
        - find way to indicate degeneracy
        - color negative modes to stand out

    Use horizontal charts for long labels

    Highlight interesting data so the reader's eye goes to the right place

### Project Ideas ###
#####################

    Interactive visualization with GII data
        - Bokeh or GLUE
        - create Ashby plots (open circle) with any two variables
        - be able to click on stuff to get more info
        - selectively load data by slider (based on anion, transition metal n, )

    3 levels
        - Minimum product	: Plot X vs GII, color by anion, toggleable legend
        - Realistic product	: Dropdown boxes for plotting any variable against any other
        - Reach goal		: Configurable coloring (color by X varirable)
	                        : 3D plot, KDE, built-in clustering 
                            : double-sided slider for range of atomic numbers for transition metal
    
    Tool for visualizing DFT stuff
        - relaxation?
        - phonons modes?
