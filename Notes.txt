### Extra hot tips ###
######################

    Open circle is the best for aggregate data
    Ensure strong visual boundaries for different symbols plotted (circle, plus, star, carrot)
    Make different navigational elements visually distinct
    Use shapes before color
        - Use color semantically if possible
        - avoid color if it introduces false relations
    Use horizontal charts for long labels
    Highlight interesting data so the reader's eye goes to the right place

### Introduction/Elements of Style ###
######################################
 
    Narrative
        - visualizations should serve the story
        - There should be only one conlcusion to be drawn from a figure

    Pre-/post-attentive
        - does my figure require a "serial search" / does it have conjunction target
        - Try to have only 1 unique pattern/characteristic that people can notice

    Gestalt Principles
        - Figure/ground
        - Similar shape, size
        - Proximity
        - Connection
        - Common region - objects in the same closed region are grouped
        - Continuity
        - Enclosure
        - Focal point

    Salient features <==> STAND OUT

    Make different navigational elements visually distinct

    Use shapes before color -- Use color semantically if possible

    Best/summary info should be the FIRST in the caption


### Matplotlib ###
##################

    (PROJECT) --> phonon plot 
        - make horizontal
        - find way to indicate degeneracy
        - color negative modes to stand out

    Use horizontal charts for long labels

    Highlight interesting data so the reader's eye goes to the right place

### Project Ideas ###
#####################

    maybe Plotly?, 

    Interactive Bokeh visualization with GII data
        - We want to easily explore this data and its many potential subsets.
        - We want to be able to compare characteristics of these subsets across variables.

    3 levels
        1. Minimum product	
            - Plot X vs Y                               (Bokeh)
            - Color by anion                            (Bokeh)
            - Toggleable legend                         (Bokeh)

        2. Realistic product	
            - Configurable coloring                                             (Bokeh)
            - Checkbox selector for tmetals, anions, spacegroups, crystal sys   (Bokeh)
            - Population plots next to it                                       (Bokeh)

        3. Reach goals		
            - Customize how many plots are shown            (?)
            - KDE buttons                                   (?)
            - Checkbox selector in shape of periodic table  (probably D3)


    Tool for visualizing DFT stuff
        - relaxation?
        - phonons modes?

### Presentation Outline ###

    Context (Materials Project website)
        - As in many fields, there is a kind of data explosion occurring in materials science.
        - Databases such as this one here called the Materials project have enormous numbers of observations on enormous numbers of materials.

        - The rise of these databases has in many ways outpaced our ability to make meaningful analyses of all this new data using traditional methods.
        - We need new tools which allow us to put this mountain of data to work answering both old but important questions and new, exciting questions in our field.
        - A few such questions include:

            1. How do materials properties vary by their atomic components?
            1. Where should we look for new compounds with X characteristic?
            1. What can we learn from the relationships between known materials properties?
            1. What can we learn from the distributions of materials properties?
            1. Where are we lacking materials data?

        - The visualization tool I've created here, called the High-Dimensional Materials Data Explorer provides a way for researchers to simultaneously consider many materials properties for many different compounds.

        - The main features here are the two scatter plots with configurable axes, meaning we can plot any property versus any other property in the data set.
        - On the edges of each scatterplot we show a kernel density estimate to give us an idea of the distribution of data in each dimension.
        - The data displayed here has different categories (corresponding to the anion) separated visually by color and marker style. By clicking on the legend entries, the user can customize which categories are displayed on the plot.
        - We can pan and zoom each plot and the KDE plots will respond appropriately
        - The tooltip gives some basic info about each data point
        - And finally, we can utilize linked brushing between these two plots. So if I'm plotting different things on each plot, I can select data and see it highlighted on the other plot

        - To create this tool, I used the Python package Bokeh.
        - Since a lot of crystal structure manipulation tools and databases have good integration with Python, I used Bokeh to maintain that Python pipeline from data import to visualization
        - You may notice, however, that this tool is just an html file
        - By choosing to create all of the interactive features using embedded JavaScript rather than Python, I've produced a final product which is fully portable and requires only a web browser to use.
        - Ultimately, I hope this tool provides a canvas on which materials researchers can project their existing chemical and physical intuition onto any organized trove of observations either from their own work or scraped from one of the many databases.
        - Furthermore, The portability and minimal system requirements enables researchers to easily share their visualizations and thereby leverage the materials intuition and feedback of a wider community.
