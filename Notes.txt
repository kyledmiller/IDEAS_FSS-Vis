### Extra hot tips ###
######################

    Open circle is the best for aggregate data
    Ensure strong visual boundaries for different symbols plotted (circle, plus, star, carrot)
    Make different navigational elements visually distinct
    Use shapes before color
        - Use color semantically if possible
        - avoid color if it introduces false relations
    Use horizontal charts for long labels
    Highlight interesting data so the reader's eye goes to the right place

### Introduction/Elements of Style ###
######################################
 
    Narrative
        - visualizations should serve the story
        - There should be only one conlcusion to be drawn from a figure

    Pre-/post-attentive
        - does my figure require a "serial search" / does it have conjunction target
        - Try to have only 1 unique pattern/characteristic that people can notice

    Gestalt Principles
        - Figure/ground
        - Similar shape, size
        - Proximity
        - Connection
        - Common region - objects in the same closed region are grouped
        - Continuity
        - Enclosure
        - Focal point

    Salient features <==> STAND OUT

    Make different navigational elements visually distinct

    Use shapes before color -- Use color semantically if possible

    Best/summary info should be the FIRST in the caption


### Matplotlib ###
##################

    (PROJECT) --> phonon plot 
        - make horizontal
        - find way to indicate degeneracy
        - color negative modes to stand out

    Use horizontal charts for long labels

    Highlight interesting data so the reader's eye goes to the right place

    maybe Plotly?, 

    Interactive Bokeh visualization with GII data
        - We want to easily explore this data and its many potential subsets.
        - We want to be able to compare characteristics of these subsets across variables.

    3 levels
        1. Minimum product	
            - Plot X vs Y                               (Bokeh)
            - Color by anion                            (Bokeh)
            - Toggleable legend                         (Bokeh)

        2. Realistic product	
            - Configurable coloring                                             (Bokeh)
            - Checkbox selector for tmetals, anions, spacegroups, crystal sys   (Bokeh)
            - Population plots next to it                                       (Bokeh)

        3. Reach goals		
            - Customize how many plots are shown            (?)
            - KDE buttons                                   (?)
            - Checkbox selector in shape of periodic table  (probably D3)


    Tool for visualizing DFT stuff
        - relaxation?
        - phonons modes?
